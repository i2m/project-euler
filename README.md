# Project Euler solutions (in Haskell)

## Getting started

### Build

To build a project, you may choose one of the following:

- build all solutions at once

```shell
cabal build
```

- build a specific solution:

```shell
cabal build problem-<n>
```
where `n` is the number of the problem

### Run

To run a specific solution use:

```shell
cabal exec problem-<n>
```
where `n` is the number of the problem

### Tests

To run tests type:

```shell
cabal test
```
